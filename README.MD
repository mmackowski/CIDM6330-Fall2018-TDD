## Chapter 01

Setting up your first functional test

## Chapter 03

Completed all exercises in chapter three. The book did not call for a Chapter 3 branch, nor did it say to merge with master, so everything at this stage is still in the Chapter 2 branch.

## Chapter 04

Went ahead and made a branch for Chapter 04.

## Chapter 05

All unit tests and functional tests working.

## Chapter 06

All tests working correctly; functional tests rolled into manage.py test suite

## Chapter 07

All major refactoring done throughout the chapter; unit and functional tests all passing. With Chapter 7 complete, I'm going to merge this back into master.
