## Chapter 01

Setting up your first functional test

## Chapter 03

Completed all exercises in chapter three. The book did not call for a Chapter 3 branch, nor did it say to merge with master, so everything at this stage is still in the Chapter 2 branch.

## Chapter 04
Went ahead and made a branch for Chapter 04.

## Chapter 05
All unit tests and functional tests working.
